Good Evening..

Done about as much as I can with the time I had available.
It's not compiled and it's not complete. I have had no experience
with Maven and JSON, very little with parsing. Most of my previous
scripting in Java experience was configuration and action based, or 
editting/tweaking existing testcases.

I've included comments to display my intent and logic where possible.
